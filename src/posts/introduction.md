# 3...2...1...Takeoff!
Hi there! My name is Richard III.

I would like to personally _thank you_ for taking the time to check out my blog, ___Leiiid by Example___. This first post marks the launch of my brand, __L.E.III.D.__
> ___Loveless Engineering | Design | Development | Deployment___

The first thing you'll notice about me is that I wear many hats. I'm a graduate student, aspiring software engineer, aspiring entrepreneur, gearhead, 3D-printing enthusiast, and musician. Without a doubt, I have obtained an _unreasonably_ broad knowledge-base through personal endeavors, various hobbies I've explored, as well as academic studies. I want to translate these experiences into accessible information for the benefit of others, just like _you_.

# New Blog Resolutions 
In this blog, I aim to deliver quality content in a multitude of areas. I have outlined several goals I would like to accomplish:
1. Get into the habit of writing on a _somewhat_ consistent basis. _(50 posts by the end of 2021)_
2. Showcase and track project progress.
3. Write _How To_ and _DIY_ guides for topics involving software development, product design, and content creation. 
4. Deliver in-depth buying guides and reviews for both software and hardware related products.
5. Document the lessons I learn as I navigate my way to becoming a small business owner by the end of 2021.
6. __Have fun along the way.__

# Where Do We Go From Here?
While I feel like there are _thousands_ of ideas rattling around my head, I do have a few that come to mind, but no spoilers!...

Maybe one. 

Together, you and I will transform this minimal site into a fully functioning blog! Our goal is to deliver an open-sourced individual blogging platform, with offerings and features similar to those of many top content management systems (CMS), and the best part, for __free!__. 

If this seems too large or too difficult of a project to accomplish, I would like to offer two famous quotes in response:

> _"Challenge Accepted!"_

\- __Barney Stinson__ | _How I Met Your Mother_ (2005-2014)

> _"Rome was not built in one day."_

\- __John Heywood__ | _A Dialogue Conteinyng the Nomber in Effect of all the Prouerbes in the Englishe Tongue_ (c. 1538)
